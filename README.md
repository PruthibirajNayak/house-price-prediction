# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on the size of the house (in square feet) and the number of bedrooms.

## **How It Works**

1. **Data Preparation**: We use a simple dataset with house sizes, number of bedrooms, and prices.
2. **Model Training**: A Linear Regression model is trained to learn the relationship between size, bedrooms, and price.
3. **Deployment**: The trained model is deployed as a web service using Flask, allowing users to get price predictions via an API.

## **How to Run the Project**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
